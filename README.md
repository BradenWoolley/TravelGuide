## General info
This project aimed to create a mobile application using Unity technologies and principles such as Scriptable Objects to easliy update data for behaviours.
The application's function is to be a tourist guide application which lists different cities in a particular country (the application uses Serbia as an example).
For each city there are several activity types such as restaurant recommendations or sites to vist.
Each activity displays a short paragraph of information for itself and if the user presses the activity's icon they will be redirected to their device's default map application to find the activity.
Additionally the application has a list of some common phrases and audio for each to be able to communicate somewhat in the country.
	
## Technologies

* Unity 2020.3.11f1

## Planned updates
